# E-Textiles
October 22nd, 2019

Liza Stark

During this week students will be introduced to an overview of the field of electronic textiles, example works in the field as well as materials and technical developments that have made these projects possible. We will go into details on different techniques for making soft/flexible/fabric circuits.

Circuit: a path for electricity flow
a stream of electrons creates an electrical current, moving from greater to lesser energy (E)
power: positive connection + anode
ground: negative connection - cathode
diode: can only flow through it in one direction

voltage: electrical pressure/force between 2 points
current: rate at which electrical charge flows
resistance: the amount of material that resists the flow of the current

## Ohm's law
V = I*R
voltage(volt)=current(ampere)*resistance(ohm)

1. electrical flow always follows the path of least resistance
2. all electrical energy has to be used!! otherwise it will dissipate as heat and can damage your circuit
3. circuits are a system

consider the properties of the materials and the threads, look at slides
inks and tapes can also be very useful for e-textiles
copper tape is great for prototypes (after you made a breadboard prototype)

tools:
pliers,
felting needles,
beeswax,
snap press to make connections
etc

multimeter,
soldering iron,
alligator clips

cameo vinyl cutter (for fabric as well!)

## Traces
We don't need the same precision in the traces as in normal circuits so we can be more creative
- iron or sewn on conductive fabrics
- use conductive threads (machine or handstitched)
- tape and ink

second skin (rachel freire)
fractal antennae (afroditi psarra)
the embroidered computer

hard to soft: connections
you can make really pretty connectors, decorate them etc

permanent or temporary connectors
ALWAYS cover knots and joints with fabric or hot glue
solder onto the fabric if you can

snaps are great as an on and off button

don't forget to isolate the traces!! all of the problems you encounter are opportunities to make it beautiful

## how to make sensors

## SWITCHES
input: information or data that enters a system (like a button press)
switch: a break in a circuit
momentary switch: stay open as long as you hold them by pressing conductive materials into contact (press buttons)
toggle switch: press/zip/slide/etc
tilt switch: a conductive whatever makes contact with the circuit based on its orientation/position
stroke switch: close circuit by pressing conductive materials into contact

## SENSORS
making use of resistance of materials
(make use of materials like velostat and eeontex)

HOW TO CHANGE RESISTANCE
distance: resistance increases over distance
contact: some materials are pressure sensitive will decrease in resistance when pressure is applied to them
surface area: increasing the size of the are for electricity to flow will descrease resistance

pressure sensors: resistance decreases when pressed, so more electricity will flow through circuit
bend sensor: resistance decreases when bent and more contact is made (great for joints)
potentiometer: adjust resistance by using a wiper (the farther the more resistance)
stretch sensor: the more stretched the more resistance (knits!!)
accelerometer: using a weight to increase resistance using acceleration of for example swinging the weight (look at mika satomi's crochet accelerometer)

## microcontrollers

input>process>output>feedback>repeat

arduino
lilypad

a pin is how inputs and outputs communicate with arduino
serial pins: transmit and receive data
3 ground pins
3 power pins
14 digital I/O pins (input/output)
6 PWM pins ~ output range 0-255 (pulse width modulation, to fade, rotate, range whatever)
6 analog input pins (0-1023)

arduino IDE
- top to bottom
- everything in setup happens once
- everything in loop happens forever
- baud rate!!! 9600


## ELECTRICITY
mechanical, thermal, sonic, electrical

where does it come from? electrons

atom=group of particles that stay together

use different knives for different materials (copper tape) because it will go blunt much slower
