# Digital Bodies
October 1st, 2019

Anastasia Pistofidou

This class introduces new digital tools that complement hand tools in order to design, represent, make and modify the human figure that can then be used as a canvas for creation.

egyptian grid system > greek kouros 7th century proportions > da vinci vitruvian man > le corbusier Modulor II 1943-55 (based on fibonacci, golden ratio). if all parts are related to each other there is harmony. michaelangelo's david is an expression, it is distorted (big hands and feet), they take this freedom to point out things in the human figure. 

durer 5 principles
- balance
- proportion
- rhythm
- emphasis
- unity

fashion uses the body like the urban planner uses the map

_what if we change the base and we have another medium to create upon?_

fashion has many conventions, many standards (S/M/L)

# the digital tailor

made to measure > bespoke > mass production (Levi's first brand to do this) > heading towards an era of mass customization

(extra reading on the wiki)
read: old media, digitized, make new forms (martin gayford)

art is pushing for new technologies, to carry out certain projects that otherwise would have been impossible, artists want to liberate their ideas, needs scientists for this

- collaboration between what art wants, and what science can

er is meer dan alleen de mannequins van school, de standaardmaten zonder benen en armen en hoofd, wat als je die basis verandert? hoe is dat van invloed op je werkproces en eindresultaten?

how are mannequins made? respond to current body type preferences and ideals
ralph pucci - the art of the mannequin

gruppocorso.nl 

fab textiles:
- rig mannequin, waffle structure, lasercut
- ada mannequin, stack slices, lasercut
- rena mannequin, vacuum formed on cnc milled molds (not a succes)
- mina mannequin, cnc milled
- mannequin, 3d printed (wasp, 1m x 1m x 1m) 1,5h to produce, extrusion very big, not really usable

- the ultimate flat pack mannequino
- open source 3d printed torso (thingiverse)
- euveka.com adjustable (inflatable) mannequin

the mannequin is the language of communication of the body

# functional body parts and inclusive design

- victoria modesta
- prosthetics (for example alt limb pro)
- exoskeletons

# software
  (see documentation)
1. modeling
2. scanning
3. downloading
(4. remixing)

3d scanning:
- computer vision
- interaction
- medical

technologies:
- photogrammetry
- laser-scanning (laser triangulation, laser pulse)
- contact-based
- structured light

using a kinect is a low cost alternative to 3d scanners, based on triangulation
working with infrared light, limiting technology works better in lower light
(webcam is also possible, facial recognition)
phone apps are also developed now, may be better in the future (trnio, qlone, Regard3D)
bodi.me

- milkscanner, fluid scanning

make a tolerance test first before making a sliced mannequin

# Workshop
examples pinterest
glitched shapes, futurist humans / cyborg
look for inspiration, sends a message about who you are and what your vision is

add layer on top? sci fi feel light emitting shimmering shell

## MakeHuman Blender
Modelling section to shape the body
Geometries has clothes and they are terrible
Materials is for skin colors, eyes, hair etc
Pose speaks for itself (set options of poses, you can download poses google this)
Expressions idem dito

Bottom menu
Gender for breasts etc. subtler differences
Face, Torso, Arms and Legs same, check Category menu on the right
You can also work with Measure (first create the body roughly that you want) and then insert the measurements
there is also a button to make left and right the same (top bar)
With Rhino you can then add elements (probably also with C4D like I did before)
You cannot just set the height you have to 'build' this (because of proportions)
!!!!!! finished: save first, then export as .obj or .stl !!!!!!
you can also add textures
export as lightmap or uv map (first one with gradients and shadows)
biodivision hierarchy is ...

## Slicer for Fusion 360
is amazing and easy to use
modify form is useful to make it hollow (and to thicken and shrinkwrap it, both thicken it but differently)

## Ideas:
Modular mannequin? for gender non-conforming people, men and women and everything in between
or a caricature mannequin like victorian cartoon shapes
or moving/movable mannequin > ligt aan de constructiewijze, met een stokje in het midden en dan ronddraaien om een heup te verplaatsen en dan uiteindelijk automatisch laten bewegen
or futurist sculpture (capturing movement)
exxagerating pose and shape
if we're not making mannequins for real bodies, why should I? absurdist take

if i'm gonna use a mannequin I need arms and legs and heads and it has to be modular (and movable preferably)

"Character designers learn how to exaggerate a cartoon character's proportions so they're unbelievable enough to have visual appeal but believable enough that audiences will actually care about them.

This exaggerated anatomy has shaped the iconic look of cartoons to the point where we can't imagine toons without noodly limbs, giant heads, ridiculously large shoulders, preposterously tiny waistlines and great big eyes.

But if these same proportions were applied to living people the results would be horrific, as the simple acts of looking, walking, lifting, standing and giving birth ravage bodies too imbalanced to function properly.

Their brains would struggle in vain to process all the information presented by their big eyes, their noodle arms and legs would make movement and muscular exertion of any kind excruciating, and don't even get me started on giant toon heads and childbirth..."

DOCUMENT IT (using slicer, lasercutter, makeHuman, research)

inspiration:

painters playing with proportions
modigliani
botero

gather references


lasercut: 
ai or dxf export
same size if it is correct


milling machine (shopbot) cannot cut square corners so it cuts a dogbone so the inside is a square

## Review (wk2)
notes
- you can also look at existing bodies online (downloadable for free or for money)
- check student documentation for tutorials on how to use all of the software
- write down all of the settings you use for every material!!
- document some process and output of fabricademy on own documentation site
- smoothing of the mesh only works if the surface is already not very detailed
- try out sketchFab for different settings and textures for 3d models
- make the human walk around in blender
