# Biofabricating materials
October 29th, 2019

NOTES

## What are biomaterials?

three categories
- bio-based: what are they made of? the raw material: biological
- bio-degradable: possibly broken down by microbes under certain conditions
- bio-compostable: complete microbial breakdown in 180 days or less (!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

crafted and grown materials; plastics, bricks, yarns, leathers; raw ingredients and made materials

not everything about plastic is bad: good to use for long term use, bad for disposable products
(introduce slide with 8 issues of plastic)
use and produce it ethically!!!

## What are plastics?
polymers combines with plasticizer/filler(to avoid shrinkage)/stiffening agent/expanding agent (rubbers, air filled materials) and color/pigment

Processes plastic
many possibilities such as:
assembling
glueing
stitching
cutting
milling
heat shaping
impressing 3d patterns
extruding

## Bioplastics 
(that are bio-compostable) (look at slides for recipes)
- gelatine: very pliable (not very water resistant and heat resistant)
- agar: a jelly-like substance from red algae. made by mixing water, glycerine and agar-agar powder. not very waterproof or heat resistant)
- alginate: mix alginate with water and glycerine (waterproof if the water is not alkaline and heat resistant until 150 degrees celsius)
- casein
- cellulose
- chitine
- starch

you are never the inventor of these materials, we are creating one big library of variations but all of these recipes have been used since forever until we switched to oil based plastics. a lot are heritage techniques

do a project with biomaterials!!!

## New leathers
- microbial: kombucha (scoby) you can dry it in full 3d shapes
- fish: inuit suits (natural tanning is way better than chemical tanning), very durable and strong (esp. salmon skin). you can also make jellyfish leather
- fruit: fruitleather rotterdam
- algae
- tempeh
- fungii
- lab grown
- mycelium (vegan leather; gradozero's muskin)

suzanne lee: kombucha master
kawasaki kazuya!!!!!! look at video (digital fabrication methods and kombucha)
moya hoke: growing in shape (welded coated metal) so no waste materials

## Mixed 
forest wool pine tree fibers
bark fabric (studiosarmite.com) (leather like material)
cow stomach leather (billievankatwijk.com)

## Material archives
(look at slides)
material archive
fabtextiles
material experience

zhdk material

document very well so you can always get back to a material!!! otherwise you can never reproduce something
even all of your mistakes, document everything, you can encounter a lot of cool stuff
