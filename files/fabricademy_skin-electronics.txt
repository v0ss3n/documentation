In the same way that the wearables industry is integrating fashion practices in their development, we envision new partnerships between the biotech/tech companies and skin professionals such as makeup artists.

## Notes

Cyborg's fashion
Looking at what's possible and what could be possible
Electronics into everyday life
on your skin > fabrics and temporary tattoos
Biostamp, l'oreal My UV Patch, Rogers Research Group

## on-body technologies 
- inside the body
- carried-on (smartphone)
- on the body
  - wearables: clothing, accessories
  - skin interfaces: direct on skin, skin appendages

beauty technology book 
wearability: factors for skin interfaces

## Body characteristics 
are factors that have to be taken into account: skin types (sensitive, dry/oily skin etc.), wrinkles, moisturization, body hair, acne/wounds, cosmetic use
wearables: size, shape etc

## Body modifications now:
- prosthetics
- hair extensions
- acrylic nails
- eye lashes
- tattoos
- makeup

location, body movements and body characteristics
attachment methods, weight, insulation, accessibility, communication 
interaction, aesthetics, conductors, device care and connection, battery life

## Attachment
belts, watches, clothing, clips
just the skin: tattoo paper, silicones
LED lashes etc.

## Conductors
- conductive ink
- epidermal electronics
- conductive cosmetics
- cPDMS
- eGaln (liquid metal)

What does it mean to have a skin?
responsive, tells us information, packaging of the body, senses, touch, warm, biggest organ

## Cosmetics
didn't change that much over time > red lipstick, black eye makeup

skin as interactive platform
the conscious use of unconscious behaviors: fidgeting, looking at watch, stroking hair/beard etc.
touch your hair when you're anxious/flirting/etc. > unconscious auto-contact behaviors > can be connected to conscious use

## Hairware 
Conductive hair extensions as capacitive touch input devices (chemical process)
examples:
- send a message
- recording a conversation (spying)
- send your location
- taking a selfie

## Makeup
Conductive makeup > winking with conductive eyeliner and lashes to detect blinking
FX e-makeup 
Winkymote: infrared remote control for individuals with quadriplegic disability
Kinisi
Chromoskin: changing makeup automatically > color changing eye shadow

## Fingers
Twinkle Nails: to play music notes in the air
Oyster card in nails
AquaDJing

- Unnoticeable wearable devices that camouflage 
a new subfield in wearable computing that through 
okay look at slide

## The skin as a display
The dermal abyss: when tattoos meet biotechnology
monitoring diseases, quantify self

skin as an interactive display

## On-skin rapid prototyping
- skin interface: FX makeup: liquid latex, skin glue, glitter; electronics: LEDs, fine wires, insulation (no insulation and oily skin could short the circuit)
- nail interface
- hair interface
- electronics into a belt
- water interfaces
