# About
Michelle Vossen is an artist and designer from the Netherlands, who graduated with honors from a bachelor Fashion Design at ArtEZ Institute of the Arts. She is fascinated by software, machines and technology, which is revealed through different aspects of her work. Her graduation collection DRESSCODE is an experimental study of the relationship between man and machine, and between technology and material.

Her goal is to further experiment with bringing fashion, art and technology closer together, to a level where absurdism sometimes surpasses practicality. Her work is about connecting the physical with the digital, the crafted by hand and the machine made. She combines analog and digital image manipulation to arrive at designs and prints, uses digital fabrication methods and is inspired by all kinds of online phenomena. In addition, fun and humor are of great importance to her: her work does not have to make sense at first (and second) sight. She is constantly searching for meaning, but even more intrigued by simulation of significance: empty symbols, images without deeper content and visual stories without purpose.
