##### About Waag
Waag operates at the intersection of science, technology and the arts. Their work focuses on emergent technologies as instruments of social change, and is guided by the values of fairness, openness and inclusivity. Waagâ€™s dedicated team of sixty thinkers and makers empowers people to become active citizens through technology.

> Making technology & society more open, fair and inclusive.

Waag is a middle-ground organisation composed of research groups that work with both grassroots initiatives and institutional partners across Europe. The collective has a shared attitude of public concern and civic activism, which is manifested in our public research agenda. Working with emergent technologies, Waag conducts research in both imaginative and practical terms, addressing its fellow citizens from a position of equality and collaboration.

##### Public Research consists of the following groups:

- Make has a DIY attitude, researching societal and ecological questions through hardware, production processes and materials.
- Code works to raise awareness of the consequences of new technology and develops concrete alternatives to make citizens more resilient and agile.
- Learn focuses on contemporary education and heritage and explores experiential disciplines to help people meaningfully participate in society.
- Care uses co-creation to work with users, designers, artists and developers to research and develop innovative concepts for the healthcare sector.
