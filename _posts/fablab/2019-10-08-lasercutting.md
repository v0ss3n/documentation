# Lasercutter

## Materials
- No pvc based material (toxic)
- Don't use vinyl either
- Put smelly materials in a bag or in a bucket of cold water
- No MDF because of the glue used
- Hardwood / plywood is fine, may be post-processed

## Fabrics
- Natural fabrics: only with vlisofix in between (45 degrees direction of thread in two directions) because of fraying of the fabric
- Leather: vegetable tanned, otherwise do not use chrome 6 will be released if it is chemically tanned
- Felt: ask if it is lasercuttable (flame test: blue or green do not lasercut; if the smell is burned hair then it's fine)
- Scubaknit is lasercuttable, neoprene not really
- Spacerfabric: do not use
- No vinyls, nothing that contains chlorine
- Organza is nice (synthetic)
- Use wet paper on fabric so it won't move as much

## Misc
- Soft stop error: check if your file is placed outside of the laser bed in the software
