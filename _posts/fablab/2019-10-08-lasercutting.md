# Lasercutter

## Materials
- No pvc based material (toxic)
- Don't use vinyl either
- Put smelly materials in a bag or in a bucket of cold water
- No MDF because of the glue used
- Hardwood / plywood is fine, may be post-processed

## Fabrics
- Natural fabrics: only with vlisofix in between (45 degrees direction of thread in two directions) because of fraying of the fabric
- Leather: vegetable tanned, otherwise do not use chrome 6 will be released if it is chemically tanned
- Felt: ask if it is lasercuttable (flame test: blue or green do not lasercut; if the smell is burned hair then it's fine)
- Scubaknit is lasercuttable, neoprene not really
- Spacerfabric: do not use
- No vinyls, nothing that contains chlorine
- Organza is nice (synthetic)
- Use wet paper on fabric so it won't move as much

## Misc
- Soft stop error: check if your file is placed outside of the laser bed in the software
- If you want to use a plywood mold for bioplastic casting, you can use vaseline spray to prevent the bioplastic from sticking to the wood. For alginate specifically it also helps if the material is lightly sprayed with the calcium chloride 

## Settings for specific materials
- Cutting 10mm thick perspex: 6 speed, 100 power 
- Cutting fabric using engraving for BMP's: 500 speed, 80 power
