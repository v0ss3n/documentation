# Working with a CNC milling machine

## Making a box
Since my 3D printing samples on fabric are just laying around everywhere, I want to make a box for them. I will also include a lid so they won't gather dust. 

I first started to design this box in Illustrator, but I quickly realized that this required a lot of imagining what the box would look like. I switched to Fusion360 so I could actually see in 3D what I was doing. For this I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JZKSDSyP6g) (this is part one of four). You can skip the third and fourth video if you don't need any rendering and just need to the plans for the CNC machine.

To make a CAM layout I am using the align tool recommended in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj37I88-4g).

Tips:
- Create variables from the beginning. I did not do that but halway through modeling I started to regret that. Then you can let the software calculate all of your distances instead of having to do it yourself.

- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JZKSDSyP6g): Modeling the box, bottom, and lid. Covers rabbets, grooves and miters.
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9uqHgfwfIU): Adding splines to reinforce the miters, modeling the thumb grip, and making the lid open and close using joints in Fusion.
