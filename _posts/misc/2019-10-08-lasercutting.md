# Lasercutting notes

## Fabrics
- Natural fabrics: only with vlisofix in between (45 degrees direction of thread in two directions) because of fraying of the fabric
- Leather: vegetable tanned, otherwise do not use chrome 6 will be released if it is chemically tanned
- Felt: ask if it is lasercuttable (flame test: blue or green do not lasercut; if the smell is burned hair then it's fine)
- Scubaknit is lasercuttable, neoprene not really
- Spacerfabric: do not use
- No vinyls, nothing that contains chlorine
- Organza is nice (synthetic)
