# Textiles as scaffold
November 26th, 2019

Anastasia Pistofidou

Technical textiles have various applications, among which agrotech, building, clothes, geotech, sports. In this class we will use textiles for composites, polymerisation, solidification, fabric formwork, crystallization, composites and biocomposites, agglomerates.

This class focuses on exploring techniques and applications of technical textiles in the industry. It introduces the concept of designing custom processes that require the design of a set of tools, processes and workflow.

## Assignment
- Document the concept, 3D model of the piece and document the design process
- Make two samples with 2 out of the 5 techniques to make a prototype of a textile form: fabric formwork with casting crystallization, wood-textile, resin-textile, leather molding or other
- Document the process from CAD to CAMM, document how to use the CNC mill and prototype your textile composite
- Upload your 3D model and CAMM file
- Document the 2 processes you have followed step by side from design to machine and hands-on making, materials you used, your mistakes, failures and achievements
- Use 3D modeling software to simulate your fabric deformation

## CNC 3D modeling
I will be using bioplastic as textile hardener and lightweight fabric to create 'soft' shapes. I want to link this assignment to my cryptography project so I will make a mold with a secret message. I then want to use this to create a double-layered glove with the message on the inside (but can then also be worn inside out). It's about being vulnerable; by hiding a secret here you are literally wearing your heart on your sleeve, and with a reversible glove you have a choice in showing yourself or not.

### Step 1: modeling in Fusion360
### Step 2: creating toolpaths in Partworks 3D
### Step 3: milling the model out of foam
### Step 4: creating the bioplastic
(Connect with biofabricating)
### Step 5: molding


## Crystallization
Growing salt crystals on lasercut lace
