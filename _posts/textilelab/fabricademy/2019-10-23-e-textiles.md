# e-Textiles
October 22nd, 2019

Liza Stark

During this week students will be introduced to an overview of the field of electronic textiles, example works in the field as well as materials and technical developments that have made these projects possible. We will go into details on different techniques for making soft/flexible/fabric circuits.

## Assignment
- Build at least one digital and one analogue soft sensors, using different materials and techniques.
- Document the sensor project as well as the readings got using the AnalogRead of Arduino
- Integrate the two soft sensors into one or two textile swatches using hard soft connections
- Document the circuit and itâ€™s schematic
- Document your swatches
- Upload a small video of the swatches functioning

## Concept
My soft digital sensor I integrated into my [first experimental design tool]({{ site.baseurl }}\fablab\2019\10\14\first-experimental-design-tool-test.html).
