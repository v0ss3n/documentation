# Alginate bioplastics experiments

## Leftover alginate
There was a jar filled with alginate mixed with water sitting in the textilelab since November 11th, so we wanted to see if it was still useable. It was very watery so Sarah did a test (casting a bit of the material and spraying it with sodium chloride hydrate mixed with water) to see if the alginate would solidify. That didn't work, so we decided to see if we could evaporate the water by heating the mixture to 80 degrees celsius. We did three separate tests after about 10, 20 and 30 minutes. The first try the material could barely be picked up; the second and third try were a bit better but still not very satisfying. After about 55 minutes of heating I decided to just go for it, and see what happens when I cast the alginate mixture on a lasercut mold, spray it, add fabric on top and cast the last bit of alginate mixture on top of that and spray that. I also added some blue dye (alkanet mixed with alcohol made by Sarah). It was not a succes but hopefully some drying helps.

## Flexible bioplastic
The recipe I used as a basis is the flexible bioplastic one. I also added some coloring: Sarah made a dye out of alkanet mixed with alcohol and sodium carbonate, which produces a magenta color. 

Recipe for the spray to cure the alginate bioplastic:
- 10 ml sodium chloride hydrate 
- 100 ml water

Recipe for alginate bioplastic (doubled and slightly modified):
- 24 gram alginate
- 41,9 gram glycerine
- 22,1 gram sunflower oil
- 400 ml water
- 1 tbsp magenta alkanet dye

Everything can be mixed using a blender:

The final mixture is very thick (kind of like a strawberry milkshake):

After a day of letting the mixture sit it looks like this:

## Flexible biofoil
Initially I wanted to double the recipe and add alkanet dye, but I made a mistake and added gelatine instead of glycerine. 

Using the following recipe:

- 16 gram alginate
- 40 gram glycerine
- 40 gram gelatine
- 600 ml water
- 12 ml blue alkanet dye

After that I decided to heat the mixture because the gelatine was still solid.
